*DESCRIPTION*

This project involves building an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python libraries such as NLTK. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, understand their queries, and generate meaningful responses. It uses text preprocessing, pattern matching, and predefined conversation rules to identify user intent and respond appropriately. Additional smart responses are included to handle greetings, emotions, jokes, study-related questions, and general conversations. The system incorporates fallback responses to manage unknown inputs gracefully. The chatbot runs in a Python environment and engages in real-time dialogue, simulating human-like interaction. This project demonstrates practical NLP concepts, including tokenization, regular expressions, and conversational rule design, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and beginner chatbot development.
